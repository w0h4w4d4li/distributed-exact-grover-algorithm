# Distributed Exact Grover’s Algorithm (DEGA)

This repository implements the **Distributed Exact Grover’s Algorithm (DEGA)** as presented by Zhou, Qiu & Luo in *Frontiers of Physics* (Aug 14, 2023) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. It achieves **100% success probability** for single-target search in an unordered database, with a circuit depth that depends only on the parity of the total qubit count—not on its size!
